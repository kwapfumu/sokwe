/* Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their
* child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the
* component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in
* lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.
* Note that error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree.
* An error boundary canâ€™t catch an error within itself. If an error boundary fails trying
* to render the error message, the error will propagate to the closest error boundary
*  above it. This, too, is similar to how catch {} block works in JavaScript. */
